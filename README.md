Disclaimer(some libraries may have sub files, i have mentioned most of the dependies, if a error like no module found shows up, then in your cmd run- pip install "module name"

step4: click on the run or run the code by entering - *python google_start.py*
(note: make sure, you are in the right director, to change the director where you have downloaded the code, copy the file location and use- *cd "file location"*
step5: after running the code, A message will pop-up showing a command line, copy paste the command line in the cmd again(do not run the code again, instead just copy the command line generated by the cmd or ide and paste the command line in the cmd)
(reference:  "streamlit run f:/google_solution_2021/google_start.py", the command line will look similar to this. )
