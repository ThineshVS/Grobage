            <h3>Grobage Spacer</h3>
               <p>Grobage spacer is used to allocate the spcae for NGO’s 
or for a common man who wants to plant tress.With this 
incredible tool, we will be able to connect the person who 
desperately wants to fill up his space with green but has no 
time to do so or maintain it and a volunteer who wants some 
space to grow trees for the welfare of humanity. We provide 
them a platform with which they can contact each other and 
share their thoughts.when the land is far away from the house 
and they still want to grow some trees. In this case, the local 
volunteers will help them to fill up the land with green. 
Through this platform, they can just connect and share more 
and more regarding the plantation.Planting trees not only 
increases the oxygen level or environment stability but also 
makes the soil fertile and increases the ground water level.

            <h3>Grobage Forum</h3>
               <p>This features helps the common man, botanist, NGOs or 
the volunteer to connect and ask their doubts or raise a 
query. This is more like a traditional forum where people 
used to ask their doubts or raise a query, but the activists will 
be there to help you 24x7 and this dedicated forum will have 
some FAQs, so you can go there and find your related 
queries or else you can just search using keywords and sort 
out the related queries or doubts, if you didn’t find any, you 
can raise your own and people will be able to answer the 
queries. You can go through the queries raised by your 
neighbourhood and you can go and help them in personal 
also or you can just find out common disease spreading in 
your locale and make measures accordingly.

            <h3>Track</h3>
               <p>Tracking stuff ain’t unusual, we also have our dedicated 
tracking feature where one will be able to track their tress 
growth, either the person who has volunteered to take care 
your trees will post the images of your trees or you can 
request a video calling session or photos of the trees. After 
sending the request, the volunteer will send the photos or will 
arrange for a video call. After this you can ping the request 
as satisfied and you can rate your plantation(scale 1-5). 
Through this platform, every year we will be able conduct 
some competition and reward prices for the best plantation, it 
doesn’t matter how big the plantation is, its all about the 
involvement of the volunteer and work done in that particular 
plantation.
